# Data-X Project 2022 - Mushroom classification

Repository for the project within the course **Data-X â€“ Applied Data Analytics Models in Real World Tasks (4IT439)**, at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business (VSE). Such project is conducted using Python.

Authors: Petr Nguyen, Lukas Dolezal, Roman Pavlata, Patrik Korsch, Daniel Bihany

Deadline: 24/10/2022

We have been provided with a mushroom dataset, based on which we have to create a model which will classify whether or not is particular mushroom edible.

Such tasks include data understanding and exploration, data preprocessing with feature engineering feature selection, building a model including hyperparameter tuning, with subsequent evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score.

## Machine Learning Flowchart
TBD

## Data Preprocessing
TBD (Binning + WoE)

## Feature selection
TBD (Bayesian Optimization + RFE; fit on training set)

## Final Model Selection
TBD (Bayesian Optimization; fit on training set with selected features by RFE; evaluation on validation set)

## Evaluation
TBD (evaluation on test set; confusion matrix, F1/Recall/Precision/Accuracy/AUC/Gini/Brier, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ROC Curve, Learning Curve, SHAP values).
