# Mushroom classification
We have been provided with a mushroom dataset, based on which we have to create a model which will classify whether or not is particular mushroom edible.

Such tasks include data understanding and exploration, data preprocessing with feature engineering feature selection, building a model including hyperparameter tuning, with subsequent evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score.
