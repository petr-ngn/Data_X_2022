# Mushroom classification
We have been provided with a mushroom dataset (available at Kaggle), based on which we have to create a model which will classify whether or not is particular mushroom edible, given such features.

Such tasks includes data understanding and exploration, data preprocessing including data preparation, feature engineering feature selection, building a model including hyperparameter tuning, with subsequent evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall or F1 score.
